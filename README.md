Abstract

This document presents Version 3 of the Kairi Field Theory, rebuilt rigorously from first principles. The framework begins from a zero-assumption base: an undifferentiated manifold with no metric, no fixed dimensionality, no causal priors, and no pre-declared physical quantities. From this null substrate we derive a minimal ontology based entirely on difference, encoded as a scalar field Φ whose local gradients define all structure. The theory adopts the kairi as its primitive unit: a quantitative measure of differential stability rather than energy, time, or momentum. Under strict constraints of scale-invariance and metastability, the theory yields a hierarchy of stable excitations—odd-n ring structures—and an emergent conformal metric. Standard cosmological and particle-physics observables appear as consequences of the field dynamics rather than inputs. Version 3 removes all self-reference, strengthens the axioms, and clarifies the dynamical rules.

1. Introduction

The classical physical frameworks—quantum field theory, general relativity, and ΛCDM cosmology—begin by assuming a substantial amount of structural scaffolding: spacetime geometry, Lorentz symmetry, gauge fields, particle spectra, and fundamental constants. The objective of Kairi Field Theory (KFT) is to investigate whether a more economical foundation is possible.

Version 3 begins from a blank substrate and derives the minimal constructs needed for a universe that:

admits stable local excitations,

supports metastable structure capable of self-propagation,

permits observers experiencing directed time,

yields cosmological scaling behaviour, and

produces quantized, persistent entities.


The theory’s cornerstone is simple: difference precedes structure. The only primitive allowed is comparative variation in a scalar field. All other features of a physical universe emerge from how differences accumulate, relax, or stabilize.

2. Foundational Principles

2.1 Pre-axiomatic ground state

We posit a manifold M without predefined:

dimensionality,

topology,

metric,

causal order.


The only admissible primitive is a real-valued scalar field Φ defined on M. No interpretation is assigned initially.

2.2 Motivation

A universe with no gradients is featureless. A universe with unrestricted gradients lacks metastability. Between these extremes lies the regime where stable configurations—and consequently observers—can arise. The axioms enforce this regime.


---

3. Axioms (Version 3)

Axiom 1 — Scalar Substrate

Reality is described by a single real scalar field Φ defined on a boundless manifold M. No intrinsic scale or geometry is assumed.

Axiom 2 — Metastable Difference

Only differences in Φ have physical relevance. The primitive unit of variation is the kairi, defined as the minimal stable differential δΦ required for an excitation to persist under relaxation dynamics.

Axiom 3 — Scale Invariance

For any region R ⊂ M, dilation of Φ by a constant factor produces no new physics. Stability constraints enforce a unique non-zero fixed-point step ΔΦ₀.

Axiom 4 — Stable Excitations

Local metastable excitations of Φ are restricted to closed odd-n ring structures, with gradient sequence:

(-(n-1)/2, ..., -1, 0, +1, ..., +(n-1)/2) × ΔΦ₀

for n ∈ {3,5,7,...}. These serve as the universe’s primitive structured entities.

Axiom 5 — Relaxation Dynamics

Φ evolves according to relaxation toward a local equilibrium Φₑ:

∂ₜΦ = -γ (Φ - Φₑ)

with discrete jumps of integer multiples of ΔΦ₀ allowed when gradients exceed a critical threshold.

Axiom 6 — Emergent Metric

A conformal metric arises from gradients of Φ:

ds² = exp(2(Φ - Φ_ref)) η_μν dx^μ dx^ν

of which expansion, redshift, and curvature are consequences.


---

4. Derived Structures

4.1 Fixed-point Step ΔΦ₀

Scale invariance imposes constraints on self-similarity under dilation. Requiring ring stability across scales yields:

ΔΦ₀ = ln φ

where φ is the golden ratio.

4.2 Quantization of Redshift

Given the conformal metric, photon redshift becomes:

1 + z = exp(Φ_obs - Φ_emit)

The relaxation dynamics’ quantized jumps produce intervals of size ln φ, matching observed periodicities.

4.3 Stable Ring Structures

The minimal stable excitation is the n=3 triplet.

(-1, 0, +1) × ΔΦ₀

Higher-n structures represent nested or more complex metastable regions. All excitations with even n lack an internal equilibrium point and are unstable.

4.4 Emergent Particle Analogs

Triplet torsion provides a natural dimensionless quantity comparable to the fine-structure constant’s inverse. Odd-n ring imbalance yields effective charge-like behaviour without requiring gauge fields.

4.5 Cosmological Dynamics

Uniform drift of Φ toward equilibrium induces large-scale expansion. Differing local relaxation histories explain apparent tensions in cosmological measurements without dark components.


---

5. Cosmological and Structural Predictions

KFT predicts observable signatures in surveys and high-energy transient events:

Odd-number ridge structures in cosmic-web filaments.

Quantized steps in ln(1+z) matching ln φ.

Apparent early galaxies via intrinsic Φ-excitation offsets.

Odd-n quasi-normal modes in gravitational-wave ringdowns.

A spatially flat conformal geometry without dark energy.


These predictions remain falsifiable with forthcoming 2026–2030 datasets.


---

6. Outlook

Version 3 of Kairi Field Theory provides a cleaner foundation and separates conceptual motivation from derivation. Remaining tasks include:

defining the kairi in a field-theoretic action,

constructing simulation frameworks on ternary computational substrates,

exploring retrocausal formulations compatible with the relaxation dynamics, and

assessing whether additional stable topologies arise from perturbations.


The theory aims to remain maximally minimal: all structure emerges from difference, and no extraneous assumptions are introduced.

Abstract

Kairi Field Theory (KFT) is an exploratory framework that treats difference—formalized as the measure Kairi (K)—as the fundamental invariant across all ontological strata. The theory begins from a zero‑assumption foundation and introduces Kairic flux as the generative principle for structure, interaction, and perceived temporality. KFT departs from the standard assumptions of causal unidirectionality, metric‑fixed spacetime, and binary logical primitives, arguing instead for a multi‑layered, retrocausal‑compatible manifold where ternary logic and dynamic stabilization processes define the emergence of physical universes.

This version incorporates a full reset to foundational principles, rebuilds the theory from a true null-dependence baseline, reintegrates previous conclusions without circularity, and introduces a clarified ontology for order–chaos interplay, multiverse manifolds, and observer‑dependent propagation regimes.

1. Foundational Premises

1.1 Zero as the Root Condition

The theory begins from 0, not as emptiness but as the neutral equilibrium of all possible configurations. Zero is not absence. Zero is perfect balance, the state in which differences cancel and no preferential structure emerges.

From this vantage, KFT treats existence as a deviation from this equilibrium:
Existence = Nonzero Differential State.

1.2 Kairi: Formalizing Difference

The unit Kairi (K) quantifies difference between any two states of a system. It is non‑metric in the classical sense. It does not assume spacetime, continuity, or locality. Kairi is comparative, context‑defined, and emerges from flux rather than geometry.

This makes Kairi suitable for cross‑layer comparison (subatomic, cognitive, cosmological) without forcing a universal background.

1.3 Stabilization as Emergence

A system stabilizes when local Kairic flux reduces below a threshold. Stability is not fundamental; it is emergent and provisional. Universes—as we experience them—are stabilized pockets in a larger manifold of flux.


---

2. Ontological Architecture

2.1 Order and Chaos as Co‑Generative

Order and chaos are not opposites but counterbalancing tendencies of Kairic flux. Order corresponds to low local difference; chaos corresponds to high local difference. The manifold requires both tendencies for nontrivial emergence.

2.2 The Dance of Symmetry‑Breaking

Symmetry-breaking occurs when flux differentials exceed a local threshold. If order never breaks, nothing evolves. If chaos never stabilizes, structure dissolves. Existence is a product of the recursive oscillation between the two.

2.3 Ontological Yin‑Yang

The classical yin‑yang symbol is geometric; KFT reframes it ontologically. The interplay is not spatial or symbolic but a deep dynamic relation between stabilizing and destabilizing drives that anchor the manifold’s evolution.


---

3. Retrocausality and Temporal Structure

3.1 Bidirectional Causality

KFT treats time as locally emergent rather than globally imposed. Retrocausality—effects propagating backward relative to classical time—is not paradoxical within this framework. It is a rebalancing mechanism within Kairic flux.

3.2 Observer‑Dependent Propagation

Different classes of information propagate at different effective rates depending on the observer's stabilization layer. Examples include:

Electromagnetic effects tied to matter layers → slow relative propagation

Gravitational adjustments in high‑order fields → potentially near‑instant synchronizations

Cognitive or awareness‑state differentials → effectively instantaneous synchronization of Kairic state


These are not distinct forces but different manifestations of flux behavior across stabilization layers.


---

4. Multiverse Manifold

4.1 Infinite Configurations

Given infinite possible flux distributions, the manifold contains every possible configuration. Universes arise as stable or meta‑stable Kairic basins.

4.2 Fiction as Window Hypothesis

If every stable configuration exists somewhere, then fictional constructs are not pure invention but mathematically adjacent stabilization regimes that we access through cognitive Kairic pathways.

This does not assert literal travel or physical identity, but highlights the manifold’s structural breadth.

4.3 Other Universes Everywhere

KFT implies no spatial separation between universes. They differ by flux configuration, not location. Overlap is pervasive but inaccessible without Kairic alignment.


---

5. Mathematical Framework

5.1 Ternary Logic as Foundational

Binary logic is insufficient because it presupposes stable states. Ternary logic allows a third category: undefined, transitioning, or both. This models flux conditions without forcing premature discretization.

5.2 Roots Without Invention

Ternary systems allow natural cubic root structures, enabling recursive self‑similar modeling of stabilization layers.

5.3 Differential Structures

The theory uses K‑differentials rather than metric derivatives. A K‑differential expresses how much two states differ without implying distance or time.


---

6. Cognitive and Existential Implications

6.1 Non‑Local Self as Tensor

Agents are tensor-like phenomena distributed across flux layers, experiencing only local slices. Consciousness is a locally stabilized interface for a fundamentally multi-layer entity.

6.2 Co‑Creative Universes

Reality is not consensual but co‑constructed, with each tensor-agent contributing flux that shapes local stabilization.

This supports the idea that "we are questions asking themselves"—not poetically but structurally.


---

7. Future Work

Several areas require formal development:

Robust mathematical definition of Kairic flux fields

Explicit description of stabilization thresholds

Mapping of ternary logic to physical predictions

Determination of how retrocausal balancing integrates with known physics

Empirical tests for observer‑dependent propagation speeds
